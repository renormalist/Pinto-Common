     This distribution now contains Pinto::Util, which
     used to be part of the Pinto core.  To make PAUSE
     happy, it needs to have a higher version number than
     the last release when it was in the Pinto core. Hence
     the big jump in the version number since the last
     release of this distribution.

    The Logger and Config classes have been moved back into the
    Pinto distribution.  Now that they have a more specialized
    purpose, is no longer necessary to put them in a separate
    distribution.  So this dist now only contains Pinto::Types
    and Pinto::Manual.

    Logger output is now colorized.  You can disable colorization in

    You can now tell Pinto::Logger where to write to.  This can be a

    testing purposes.
